# Ansible Playbook Primary

This repository contains the primary configuration playbooks for system setup and configuration.

## Before use
The `local.yml` playbook should be run first, as it sets up the user account that will be used by subsequent playbooks. 
For more detailed information (and zero-knowledge command), please refer to the documentation in the role used by this playbook.

## Configuration Playbooks

This repository includes various playbooks (e.g., `precision.yaml`, `thinkpad.yml`) that contain specific configurations.
